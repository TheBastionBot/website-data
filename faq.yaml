- question: The installer/updater stops with a <code>Killed</code> error or Bastion stops with a <code>Killed</code> error in the logs, what do I do?
  answer: This error happens when on low memory (e.g. 512 MB) Computers/Servers that don't have a swap file or if the swap size is not enough. But don't worry, it's not a big deal. It can be fixed easily by adding/updating the swap file (I recommend the size of swap file to be double the size of your RAM). If you don't know how to do that, follow the steps given [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-12-04?comment=551).

- question: What can I do with Bastion currency?
  answer: You can sell & buy stuff from the shops (gift shop, server shop or role shop), you can also gamble in the games in the gambling module. You can also give your Bastion Currency to your friends. And many new features are being added every day to Bastion, so there might be many more ways you can use your currency in future releases of Bastion.
  image:

- question: How can I get Bastion Currency?
  answer: You get currency when you level up in the server. You can also get more currency when you win in gambling games. There's also a weekly currency giveaway in Bastion HQ where you can get huge amount of Bastion Currencies. But the two best ways to get more currencies is to use the `claim` or `daily` command every day and if you're a server owner, you can sell items/roles in your server and when users buy it, you'll get 90% of the profit.
  image:

- question: How can I get more Bastion Currency with the claim or daily command?
  answer: You can normally get upto 100 Bastion Currencies when you use the `claim` or `daily` command. But you can get 200% more Bastion currencies if you use the `claim` or `daily` command in [Bastion HQ](https://discord.gg/fzx8fkt). Also, if you've ever donated us on PayPal or if you've ever been our Patron, you'll get another 100 Bastion Currencies added to your daily reward. And if you're currently our Patron, 500 Bastion Currencies will be added instead.

- question: Music commands are not working in the Public Bastion Bot?
  answer: Music is disabled in the Public Bastion Bot due to high hosting and maintenance costs for serving music to a huge number of Discord Servers. If you want to use the music module, try [hosting Bastion](https://docs.bastionbot.org/) on your computer/server.
  image:

- question: Why is my music laggy?
  answer: That can be due to various reasons. Maybe your computer/server, where you are hosting the Bastion Bot, has connection/bandwidth issues. Or latency from your computer/server to Discord is high. [Try changing your Discord Voice Server region](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/216661717-How-do-I-change-my-Voice-Server-Region-) to a location near your computer/server.
